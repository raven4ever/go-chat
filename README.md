# GO Chat

This project aims to create a chat application. The application is split into two parts, the server and the client. The server is a TCP server that listens for connections on a specified port. The client is a TCP client that connects to the server on a specified port.

The server will be responsible for handling all the connections and messages between the clients. The server will also be responsible for storing the messages in a database. The client will be responsible for sending messages to the server and displaying messages from the server.

The server will also have a web interface that will allow users to view the messages that have been sent. The web interface will also allow users to send messages to the server.
